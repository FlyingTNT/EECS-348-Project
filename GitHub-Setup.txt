Make ssh key pair. Give the public one to GitHub, save the private one in local ssh.
(we did this in lab 1)

For adding the key to local ssh (I have to do this every time I start the console):
 - Open console in project folder
 - run: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	- This starts the SSH angent
 - run: ssh-add SSH
	- This adds the provate ssh key to the local ssh.
	- Need to replace SSH with the name of the file containing the provate key
		- Need to also add the path to the file if it isn't in the same folder

Setting up GitHub
 - Have GitHub installed
 - Have a console opened in the folder you intend to use for the project
 - Have your ssh key added to the local ssh
	- If you don't, you will get this message when pushing: git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
		- If this happens, follow the instructions above.
 - run: git init
	- Sets up git in that folder
 - run: git remote add origin git@github.com:FlyingTNT/EECS-348-Project.git
	- Adds to the list of remote directories one called 'origin' that points to the project
 - run: git remote -v
	- Just prints the remotes. Origin should be there
 - run: git checkout main
	- Moves you to the main branch.
	- This may not work. If it doesn't, try 'git checkout -M main' and then talk to me
 - You should be good to add -> commit -> push
	- Note that for your first push you will have to do 'git push -u origin main'
	- For subsequent ones, you should be able to just do git push
